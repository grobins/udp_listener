# udp_listener
small node server that listens to logs sent from my router

TODO: parse the messages to pull out device connections

2015-03-21 01:25 - altered the app.js to listen to sensor data being sent from my phone using the 'Sensor Node' app.
have decoded the buffer array to show the accelerometer data.  Need to convert the message to json to use with some graphing libraries.
